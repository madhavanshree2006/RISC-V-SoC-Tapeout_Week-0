# 🔳 RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program — Week 0 

Welcome to the beginning of my journey in the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** 🚀.  
This repository captures my **Week 0 progress**, where I focused on understanding the program, setting up the required tools, and preparing my environment for upcoming digital VLSI experiments.

## 📖 About the Program 🔥 
The **VSD SoC Tapeout Program** is a nationwide initiative designed to teach the complete **RTL-GDSII design flow** using open-source tools.  
Here, participants like me will work through every step — from **RTL design ➡️ GDSII ➡️ Tapeout** — and contribute to India’s growing **semiconductor ecosystem** 🌍⚡.

**👏 Special Thanks ( ദ്ദി ˙ᗜ˙ )**

 I sincerely thank all the organizations and their key members for making the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program possible:

- VLSI System Design (VSD) – [Kunal Ghosh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunal-ghosh-vlsisystemdesign-com-28084836/) for mentoring and guiding the program.

- Efabless – [Michael Wishart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-wishart-81480612/) and [Mohamed Kassem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkkassem/) for enabling collaborative open-source chip design.

- [Semiconductor Laboratory](https://www.scl.gov.in/), India (SCL) – for PDK and foundry support.

- [IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN)](https://www.linkedin.com/school/indian-institute-of-technology-gandhinagar-iitgn-/?originalSubdomain=in) – for on-site training and project facilitation.

- Synopsys – [Sassine Ghazi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sassine-ghazi/) for providing industry-grade EDA tools under C2S program.

Their collective vision and support have empowered students like me to contribute to India's semiconductor journey 🚀.
